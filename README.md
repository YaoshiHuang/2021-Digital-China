Group intelligence optimisation of the tide cycle of shared bicycles during the morning rush hours

Project description 19022021
Introduction:
The popularity of shared bicycles have extended the urban public transportation network, while remarkably solved the problem 'last mile travel'. However, tide phenomenon occurs as the shared economy is becoming widly accepted by more and more citizens. It is a fact that people usually work in the daytime while rest at night. Another fact is that commuting time is highly concentrated. These facts lead to the supply-demand imbalance of bicycles and parking lots during rush hours. In this project, the circulation data of bicycles will be analysed to spot the tide cycle of the morning rush hours. Based on the tide cycle, a group intelligence optimisation plan will be designed to alleviate the supply-provide imbalance, which is expected to support the city administrations and operators of shared bicycles in strategy decisions.
